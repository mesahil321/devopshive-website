# DevOpsHive - CloudSprint Client Deployment
## 1. Introduction
This repository contains all the infrastructure-as-code and automation scripts to deliver a scalable, secure, and highly available website backend for CloudSprintâ€™s new client.
The primary goal of this project is to build a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of a containerized, auto-scaling website on AWS, following modern DevOps best practices.

## 2. Technology Stack
This project will utilize the following technologies to meet the client's requirements:
| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Provider** | Amazon Web Services (AWS) | To host all infrastructure resources. |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Terraform | To provision and manage all AWS resources. |
| **Containerization** | Docker | To package the website into a portable and consistent unit. |
| **Configuration Mgmt** | Ansible | To automate the deployment of the Docker container to servers. |
| **CI/CD Orchestration** | Jenkins | To automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline. |
| **Version Control** | Git / GitHub | To store and manage all code for the project. |
